# Harry Potter Books App

## Overview

This is a test application built to showcase my skills in handling API requests within a Flutter environment. The app integrates with a public API to fetch and display books from the Harry Potter universe. While the focus is on functionality rather than aesthetics—due to the absence of a design reference—it effectively demonstrates API integration, data management, and user interaction.

## Features

- **Browse Books**: View a list of books from the Harry Potter series.
- **Search Functionality**: Search through the book collection by title.
- **Book Details**: Access detailed information about each book, including title, description, release date, and more.

## Purpose

This project serves as a proof of concept to highlight my ability to work with APIs in Flutter. It prioritizes robust data handling over visual design, as no specific design guidelines were provided.
